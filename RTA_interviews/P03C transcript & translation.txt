P03C
[trial 2] So here I was a bit confused about the title so I was reading a couple of times. Here it went pretty quickly. I mean, usually you go back and forth if you're reading so here [NOTE: "Met veertig miljoen ... in evenwicht gebracht] I think I didn't really know what it said so I had to go back and read the sentence again
P03C  1:29
[trial 3] yeah I feel like it was going pretty smoothly. Yeah, I had to read the number again [NOTE: "hondernegentwintig]
P03C  1:41
It's funny to see how often I go back and look at like the story so far.
INT: 
And how did you like the story so far?
P03C:
I think I was still getting into it. So I'm still figuring out what was happening. Here [trial 4]. I felt like I wasn't reading 'afdeklakens' [transl. 'drop cloths'] correctly, I was like, what is this Word?
P03C  2:06
[trial 4] Like I was wondering what 'sardonisch' [transl. 'sardonic'] was, if it was an actual Dutch word or not. That's what I was going back.
I think I quite liked this part. I was seeing that I was turning into more sci fi. With, like when people are still getting older, it's like okay, I see where this is going now. They're starting to talk about the painting. And I think I was going back and forth figuring out who these people in uniforms were.
P03C  2:47
[trial 5] Yeah not much here, yeah I had to go back to saying to see like a song. Okay, do I know the song? that's what I was thinking of. Is it an existing song?
P03C  3:02
[trial 6] I think I was enjoying the song and it was pretty funny.
P03C  3:17
I had to read the title [NOTE: of the painting ('de gelukkige hof des levens')] a couple of times I don't know why, but...
P03C   3:25
[trial 7] I think this was one of the parts where I was kind of getting stuck, I had to read the sentence quite a few times[NOTE the first sentence of trial 7 'verwijzend ... man'], . I think because this is also where it started to get more clear like what the context was, it was the hospital and like this doctor figure was pretty important. So...
P03C  3:50
I remember here I was quite surprised that the painter didn't like the painting himself.
P03C   4:03
[trial 8] And then this that he said that basically that the tarp was a better representation
P03C  4:16
I was confused about the word order. So that's to go back and read the 'als het u niet bevalt, opa' [transl. 'if you don't like it, grandpa']. I had to read it out-loud in my head, that's why I went back to the number.
P03C   4:35
[trial 9] this I also wrote down in the questionnaire I was very confused because there are so many like, yeah, synonyms for the gas chambers that this sentence didn't make sense to me.
P03C  4:57
[trial 10] I though this part really represented kind of the style of the author kind of cynical, which I like to
P03C   5:20
[trial 11] I think this was a switch back to the Father which is why I had to read it again. I like the sentence 'de kleur van druiven op de dag des oordeels' [transl. 'the colour of drapes on Judgment Days']. Yeah, I was confused about the typo. I
P03C  5:42
I think I actually laughed out a little bit at this part. That they all grow mustaches after a while.
P03C  6:01
[trial 12]I like this--well now knowing it's a translation I like this wordplay on 'goed-dunken' 'Duncan'
P03C  6:28
[trial 13] √ùeah, I think it was pretty clear what I was reading. It was quite fun that first she said that she didn't know which one to choose and then later she ended up choosing one that was better.
P03C  6:56
[trial 14 & 15] Yeah, I found it funny that she was so in awe of this doctor. I was a bit confused because all of a sudden he was talking about Zeus. I was like wait, what are what does the doctor look like Zeus, or what is this?
P03C 7:23
I thought this was an interesting representation of her work. I thought okay, she's looks she looks at it pretty positively although it's kind of like morally questionable.
P03C  7:47
[trial 17] I think overall it was going pretty... I really got into the story. So reading was going quickly
P03C  7:58
[trial 18] oh here I was confused about the lawful implications of triplets. Here you really see that it's turning into science fiction
P03C 8:21
[trial 19 &20] Then I got to realize, like, the difficult position that this father was in and why he was obviously very depressed to have it.
P03C  8:42
It's funny that I'm sometimes looking a little bit above the words, I don't know if that's the eye-tracker thing.
Interviewer:  Yeah, it can be an eye-tracker thing... 
P03C   9:08
[trial 21] I quite like this part about the 'steenvruchtje' [transl. 'drupelet'], which I didn't know was a word that existed. But I liked the description. And like, connection of that and the situation of the planet would be in. 
P03C  9:30
[trial 22] I think here I was confused that they would only eat seaweed.
P03C   9:39
I was feeling for the dad at this point.
[trial 23] And here, I think I was confused about the 'kattenbak' [transl. 'litter box'] because I didn't remember because there was so many synonyms for this thing that I wasn't sure.
P03C  9:57
I think this is the first time they've mentioned the actual name.
P03C 10:23
[trial 24] This was a real plot twist that I wasn't expecting. But it was also very quick, like it went from ah so beautiful to killing a bunch of people
P03C 10:38
[trial 25] and then another plot twist were the painter was also not feeling life anymore.
P03C   10:53
Yeah, this part [NOTE: "hij dacht aan oorlog. .. hongersnood"] I didn't really understand, if he thought the war would be worse than the situation now or not, that's what I was confused about.
P03C  11:15
[trial 26] here, you were kind of feeling that the story was coming to an end
P03C  11:32
[trial 27] I though this was kind of weird for thanking him for the world and future generations.
Int: any final comments on the story or what you thought of it
P03C  11:46
think the only thing I read that it was Kurt Vonnegut and I was like ah, that makes sense because I read one of his books, which was also really weird story that I was like okay, it all falls into place now. When reading I wasn't aware that it was translated.
