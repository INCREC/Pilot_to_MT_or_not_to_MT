Int:
Hmm, okay, all right, you will see all the text again, and just so just you can, just as if you're like, saying out loud, just as if I were to just a lot of text. So okay, what was I thinking? What was I feeling? How did I do this? Etc, etc, etc. 

P05A  [0:34]
Um, just wondering what the situation was I don't remember names, so I have to remember the name of Edward. 
I was like, Okay, 'bevallen' [transl. to give birth] is also a word that I should remember.
[0:57]
At this moment, I realized it was like a science fiction... situation. Bit of a weird story because of the three, three babies. 
[1:16]
To become 200 years old [laughs] Also a bit weird.
[1:23]
And here I thought about the 'geneesmiddel' [transl. medication], they should do something with that in the rest of the story.
[1:44]
Yeah, I didn't think anything here [laughs], just eh... 

INT: Did you like the song?

P05A [1:52]
Yeah, I was wondering why he was singing that.
[1:58]
Then I was like, Oh, it's a hospital, so maybe he's sad 'ofzo' [transl. or something].
[2:17]
Um yeah, I liked the part of the painting. 
[2:25]
and also the portraits, it's brent filming [red. inaudible].

INT:
Did you like the characters, the story?

P05A:
I like the same man. First he was happy, and then it was like, no, no, I can't, just let me pull it [the gun].
[3:01]
Yeah, so the title is, eh, 'uitgelegd' [transl.. 'explained']. I wondered what was the original, original word for the 'broeder' [transl. 'brother] in English, so brother, Man. big brother.
[3:27]
And I wondered just what all these words were. 
[3:39]
Shakespeare
[3:45]
well, maybe with the do-it-selfer, is like a reference to our time, the shit people are doing to ourselves, like medication. 
[4:08]
I remembered that woman on the heels was pregnant, but I don't think she's pregnant anymore. [laughs] Okay, no, I was just thinking about the ceiling of the Galleria Borgese, also with the 'druiven' [transl. 'grapes'] and 'paars' [transl. 'purple'], purple.  
[4:21]
Here I was thinking about my mother, because my brother is always saying she has a mustache. 
[4:50]
I liked her name. [transl. Leonora Duncan]
[5:01]
Duncan Lawrence,
[5:07]
Uh, yeah, she was really 'heel snel heel sad ineens' [transl. 'very suddenly very sad at once']
[5:18]
Also a reference to other people kill themselves. Oh, you get a child, so you have to kill yourself. You're 'afvalverwerking' [transl. 'trash processing']
[5:48]
and here she's happy again, so Dr. Hitz is a high-placed person or something.
[6:02]
I suppose I liked that sentence. '"ze bloosde", is ze ineens heel nederig". [transl. '"She blushed", she suddenly became very meek'].

INT:
Did you like it or did you think it was weird?

P05A [6:16]:
I really like surrealism things, but this was sometimes a little off.

INT:
hmm, yeah, 'en volgens mij is er nu dan' [transl. 'and I think there's now'] yeah there's a break. 
You can also think about the language, or as you said like sentence you liked, or didn't  like, or words you didn't get a word, or if you find weird. 

P05A [6:40]
Also the word 'hoogsteigen' [transl. 'very own'] so the author also thinks Hitz is a high-placed person.
I really like the 'wat er zojuist is geboren' [transl. 'what was just born', it was really funny. And the 'juridische implicaties' [transl. 'juridicial implications'] [laughs].
''haar volume had te maken' was ook raar verwoord, grappig' [transl. '"her volume had to do with"' is also a weird phrasing, funny'], '"te sprokkelen" daar ging ik ook goed op" [ transl. "to gather"' also  does it for me.'] Um and I wondered about the red eyes because was he ....? high? maybe it was just happy. Or maybe crying or I don't know maybe he needed to be treated for it.
[8:20]
"'Hoera' met holle stem', [transl. '"Hooray", with hollow voice'] sounded a little weird somehow? I just forgot around this time, like Wehling who he was, the doctor or the women.
[8:59]
I felt a little like it was Homer with the sudden likening, 'the vergelijking', [transl. 'the comparison'] He was like, Oh, he's now gonna talk about random fruit or something.

INT:
And did you like that?

P05A [9:17]
Well, I didn't know the 'steenvrucht' [transl. drupelet], so I don't know what's coming.

INT:
'And did you understand 'de pappige bolletjes?'' [transl. the mushy little balls]

P05A:
'Nee' [transl. 'No.'][laughs]

P05A [9:39]
At this time I 'snapte de bolletjes'. [transl. 'understood the little balls']
[9:46]
And I was thinking about the situation now, the 'zeewier' [transl. 'seaweed'], huh?
[10:12]
There were other words for the 'crematoria, kattenbak en vrolijke nogwat'. [transl. 'the crematoria, catbox and happy somethingsomething']
Yeah, so you're saying, 'in een lusthof' [transl. 'in a pleasure garden'], which already is a little weird. Then he is shaking his head. So like, do you even believe in this euphoria? So I was kind of confused about that. Yeah... I was trying to understand if there was a weird word or something else but I didn't get it really.

INT:
and what do you think about the plot twist? 

P05A [11:01]:
Uh, so he shoots the doctor in the head? Yeah I liked the part, because like okay, how is he going to end the story? And I was like, Okay...
[11:22]
[laughs] what's happening? That was the only thing I could think of, because it was so absurd. Because everyone dies and then you just have the painter, just standing there, painting how it should be. Yeah...
And then the painter gets depressed, but 'hij had er het lef niet voor' [red. 'he didn't dare]. okay. sad. 
[12:11]
yeah, so thinking about other appointments I have to make my life, it's always a month or something, go next year, in February. Afternoon, okay, yes,

INT:
okay, I think that's it. Alright. So were there any… You can also do this final part in Dutch.
'Iets wat je verder nog opviel, leuk vond, niet leuk vond van de stijl van de tekst of dat je wist dat het een vertaling was. [red. 'something else you noticed, you liked or didn't like about the style of the text or that you realised it was a translation']

P05A:
'Nou ik had het me niet gerealiseerd, maar ik dacht wel van ja dit is logisch. Sowieso zou geen enkele Nederlander dit zo schrijven. [red. 'Well, I hadn't realised, but I think like 'yeah this makes sense'. No Dutch person would write it like this anyway.']

INT:
Want met het woord 'broeder' enzo? [red. 'because of the word 'broeder' and similar ones?']

P05A:
Jaa, met de namen; ik onthoud nooit de namen en zeker bij zo'n kort verhaal is het natuurlijk heel erg 'wie is wie' en ik kon dat echt niet uit elkaar houden. En die vrouw, ik dacht de hele tijd dat ze zwanger was, maar ze had een snor. Maar ja, nee. [red. 'Yeah, with the names. I never remember names and especially with such a short story there is a situation of 'who is who' and I couldn't keep them apart. And that woman, I thought the hole time she was pregnant, but she had a moustache. But yeah, no'.]

INT: 
Ah oke, en vond je het een leuk verhaal? [red. 'Ah okay, and did you enjoy the story?] 

P05A:
Nou ja, ik vond het wel grappig, maar het was niet erg goed. Ik zou het niet zelf lezen. [red. 'Well, I thought it was funny, but it wasn't good. I wouldn't read it myself.]

INT:
Zou je het aanraden aan anderen? [red. 'Would you recommend it to others?'] 

P05A:
Nou als ze dit soort verhalen leuk vinden dan wel. [red. 'Well, if they like these kinds of stories, I would.']

INT:
En deze versie? Of zou je zeggen 'lees maar in het Engels'? [red. 'And this version? Or would you say 'just read the English version'?']

P05A:
Ik zou sowieso in het Engels lezen. [red. 'I'd read it in English in any case'.]

INT:
En stel dat dit een Duitse tekst was? Zou je het aan mij aanraden in het Duits of Nederlands? [red. 'And what if this was a German text. Would you recommend it to me in German or Dutch?']

P05A:
Nou ja, jij kan niet zo goed Duits dus dan denk ik alsnog deze versie, maar wel met de opmerking dat de taal hier en daar niet zo mooi is. [red. 'Well, your German isn't that good, so I'd then say this version, but with the addition that the language isn't always the best here and there'.]

INT:
En Frans? [red. 'and French?']

P05A:
Dat hangt ervan af hoe goed jij Frans kent. [red. 'That depends how much French you understand'.]

INT:
Goed genoeg om een verhaal te lezen. [red. 'Enough to read a story']

P05A:
Dan zeker het Frans.  [red. 'Then definitely the French version']

INT:
Oké. Nog verdere laatste opmerkingen? Nog iets over de personages? [red. 'Okay. Any final comments? Something on the characters?']

P05A: 
Eh, ik begreep ze niet echt. Heel heen en weer springend. [red. 'Eh, I didn't really understand them. Very jumping all over the place.']
